# Ship It!

This is a very basic boilerplate to save me from me as I tend to over-engineer things that are supposed to be 'mini' and quick.

## Directories
- `assets`: This is where all your static assets like images live
- `pages`: Obviously, these are your public-facing pages 
- `src`: This is where you keep files you don't want anyone else to have access to e.g. controllers you want to require or include in your pages

## Note?
I'll probably be extending this a bit later but I don't want to end up overengineering it again haha
